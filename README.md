Clifford algebra calculations in galgebra

I performed extensive calculations using galgebra for a recent paper. 

However, the sample code of how to do these extensive calculations might be useful for other researchers and students in the Clifford algebra community, as I found tutorials/sample code a little limited. So it may be useful to see some extended Clifford projects in galgebra in action that people can see in action and adapt to their own purposes. Happy experimenting!

Thank you, Hugo Hadfield and Eric Wieser for help with setting up galgebra and Alex Konovalov for getting me started on github back when.
